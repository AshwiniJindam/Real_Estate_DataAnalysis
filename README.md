🏠 Real Estate Price Analysis Using SQL
📌 Project Overview:
 This project analyzes housing sales data to identify the key factors influencing property prices. The analysis was performed using SQL Server and includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business insights
📊 Dataset Information:
Dataset: King County Housing Data 
Total Records: 21613 
Time Period: 2014–2015
Tool Used: SQL Server (SSMS)


🧹 Data Cleaning Process:
Checked for NULL values
Verified duplicate records 
Confirmed houses sold multiple times were valid transactions


🔎 Key Business Questions:
📐 Property Size Impact 
The analysis shows that larger properties (Luxury category) have the highest average prices, showing a strong relationship between size and price.
🏅 Grade Impact 
Property grade shows a strong positive relationship with price. Higher-grade houses command premium pricing.
🌊 Waterfront Impact 
Waterfront properties have higher average prices compared to non-waterfront homes.
🛠 Renovation Impact 
Renovated properties tend to have higher selling prices than non-renovated properties.
🛏 Bedrooms Analysis
Bedroom count alone does not determine price, size and quality are stronger influencing factors.


✅ Final Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that property size and grade are the strongest drivers of housing prices. Premium features such as waterfront access and renovation status further increase property valuation
